Back in the old days of 2009, J2ME was still popular. And I had LG-GB250. 
I searched for a text editor and found only jTextLite 1.01 ((c) Malcolm Bryant & FreEPOC 2/Oct/09), but unfortunatley it didn't work.

Using decompile, I did some modification to make it work.
It was never published to anyone else, was just a kind of exercise.
